## 2. Detailed Script & Storyboard

### **Scene 1: Intro (0-7s)**

- **Visual:** Logo animation or project name with tagline: “OpenLLM Monitor: Real-time Observability for LLMs”
- **Text Overlay:** “LLMs are powerful, but unpredictable. Here’s how OpenLLM Monitor brings transparency to your GenAI stack.”
- **Action:** Fade in, short pause, fade out.

### **Scene 2: Dashboard Overview (8-20s)**

- **Visual:** Main dashboard with live stats (latency, error rate, cost, token usage).
- **Action:**
  - Hover over key metrics (latency, retries, cost, tokens).
  - Show real-time updates (simulate incoming data if needed).
- **Text/Voiceover:** “Get instant visibility into your LLM usage: latency, errors, retries, and cost — all in one place.”

### **Scene 3: Log Table & Deep Dive (21-35s)**

- **Visual:** Switch to Logs/Requests page.
- **Action:**
  - Scroll through recent requests.
  - Click on a log entry to open the detailed view.
  - Highlight prompt, completion, token breakdown, and estimated API cost.
- **Text/Voiceover:** “Every request is tracked. Dive into details: prompt, completion, token breakdown, and estimated API cost.”

### **Scene 4: Prompt Replay & Debug (36-43s)**

- **Visual:** Show the “Replay” feature.
- **Action:**
  - Select a previous request.
  - Click “Replay” to re-run the prompt and compare outputs.

### **Scene 5: Provider Switching (44-50s)**

- **Visual:** Provider switcher UI.
- **Action:**
  - Switch between OpenAI, Ollama, Mistral.
  - Show how metrics/logs update per provider.
- **Text/Voiceover:** “Monitor multiple providers — OpenAI, Ollama, Mistral — in a single dashboard.”

### **Scene 6: Plug-and-Play Setup (51-55s)**

- **Visual:** Quick start guide or code snippet (from your README).
- **Action:**
  - Show how easy it is to integrate (copy-paste code, config).
- **Text/Voiceover:** “Plug-and-play observability. Add to any GenAI project in minutes.”

### **Scene 7: Closing & Call to Action (56-60s)**

- **Visual:**
  - GitHub repo link, “Star us on GitHub”, “Try the live demo” (if available).
  - Your LinkedIn handle or QR code (optional).
- **Text/Voiceover:** “Open-source. Built for devs, by devs. Check out OpenLLM Monitor and let’s build the future of GenAI tooling together!”

## 3. Recording & Editing Tips

- Keep the video under 60 seconds.
- Use smooth transitions (zoom, fade, cursor highlights).
- Show real user interactions: clicking, hovering, switching tabs.
- Overlay short captions for accessibility and silent viewers.
- End with a strong call to action: GitHub, LinkedIn, “Let’s connect!”
- Export in high quality (1080p recommended).

## 4. Preparation Checklist

- [ ] Set up demo data (simulate logs, errors, costs).
- [ ] Ensure all providers are configured.
- [ ] Prepare a clean, distraction-free browser window.
- [ ] Use a screen recorder (OBS, Screenity, etc.).
- [ ] Record voiceover or add captions in post-editing.
- [ ] Add background music (optional, keep it subtle).
