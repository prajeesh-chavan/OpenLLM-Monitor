# Dashboard Images

This directory contains screenshots and images for the README.md file.

## Required Images

Please add the following screenshots to this directory:

1. **dashboard-overview.png** - Main dashboard showing real-time monitoring
2. **analytics-dashboard.png** - Analytics page with charts and metrics
3. **prompt-replay.png** - Prompt replay and comparison interface
4. **request-logs.png** - Request logs table with filtering

## Image Guidelines

- **Resolution**: 1920x1080 or higher
- **Format**: PNG (preferred) or JPG
- **Quality**: High quality, clear text
- **Dark/Light**: Show both themes if available
- **Annotations**: Add callouts for key features

## How to Add Images

1. Take screenshots of the running application
2. Optimize images for web (keep under 500KB each)
3. Name them exactly as listed above
4. Place them in this directory

## Placeholder Text

Until real screenshots are available, the README will show placeholder image references.

## Alternative Solutions

If you can't provide real screenshots:

1. Create mockups using design tools
2. Use placeholder services (placeholder.com)
3. Remove image references from README
4. Use ASCII art or diagrams instead
